According to the THW (2016) “volunteers worked for about 1.3 million operational hours in 2015 at the request of different parties (e.g. police, fire brigade, civil protection authorities, municipalities, district presidents, Länder governments, federal government or European Union)”.This basis of volunteers is very typical for the overall German civil protection system.In terms of operational units, the THW has at its disposal around 1,440 rescue groups and 1,000 specialist units in 722 technical platoons as well as more than 8,400 vehicles.

Der DFV arbeitet für zukunftsfähige Rahmenbedingungen, um ein verlässliches System schneller und kompetenter Hilfe in Deutschland zu sichern       Dies ist die Mission des Deutschen Feuerwehrverbandes. Er fühlt sich der Sicherheit aller Menschen in Deutschland verpflichtet. Sicherheit ist integraler Bestandteil der staatlichen Daseinsvorsorge. Sie spiegelt den Entwicklungsstand einer Gesellschaft und das Maß der Lebensqualität in einem Land wider. Der DFV wirkt daran mit, dass die Menschen durch kurze Hilfsfristen sowie durch zeitgemäß ausgebildete und ausgerüstete Einsatzkräfte gut geschützt werden. Er ist direkt für die Einsatzkräfte der Feuerwehren tätig, die den Schutz der Bevölkerung sicherstellen.2. Der DFV nimmt dazu als Spitzenverband die Interessenvertretung auf nationaler, internationaler Ebene und in der EU wahr       Voraussetzung für zukunftsfähige Rahmenbedingungen ist eine starke Interessenvertretung. Als Zusammenschluss der Landesfeuerwehrverbände und Bundesgruppen bildet der DFV den nationalen Spitzenverband, der den Feuerwehren auf Bundesebene, in der Europäischen Union und international eine einheitliche Stimme gibt. Der DFV erhält durch seine Gremien die fachlichen und politischen Mandate für die Interessenvertretung und bildet die Erwartungen seiner Mitgliedsorganisationen ab. Er ist verlässlicher Ansprechpartner von Regierungen, Organisationen und anderen Interessenvertretern.       3. Der DFV bildet als nationaler Dachverband das Netzwerk, in dem er die Kompetenzen seiner Mitglieder bündelt und kommuniziert       In seiner Meinungsbildung lebt der DFV von der Mitarbeit seiner Mitgliedsverbände und von der Kompetenz der in ihnen engagierten Menschen. Der DFV bietet den Landesfeuerwehrverbänden und Bundesgruppen eine Organisationsstruktur, um Wissen und Erfahrungen auszutauschen, um gemeinsame Ziele zu formulieren und um Informationen weiterzugeben. Er kommuniziert Arbeitsergebnisse, Positionen und Informationen innerhalb und außerhalb der Feuerwehren.       4. Der DFV setzt sich für wirksamen Gesundheitsschutz und soziale Sicherheit der Feuerwehrangehörigen ein       Männer und Frauen, die in der Hilfe für andere Menschen ihre eigene körperliche und seelische Unversehrtheit riskieren, haben Anspruch auf optimale Prävention und eine besondere Absicherung im Schadensfall. Diese Männer und Frauen stehen im Mittelpunkt der Arbeit des Deutschen Feuerwehrverbandes. Der DFV setzt sich deshalb dafür ein, dass bestehende präventive, medizinische und soziale Angebote für Feuerwehrangehörige erhalten werden und dass für neu erkannte Risiken zeitnah wirksame Lösungen gefunden werden.       5. Der DFV will den Dienst in der Feuerwehr breit in der Gesellschaft verankern und alle dafür begeistern       Deutschlands Feuerwehrleute genießen in der Bevölkerung höchstes Vertrauen. Dies ist Ausdruck ihrer uneigennützigen und professionellen haupt- oder ehrenamtlichen Tätigkeit. Motivierte Einsatzkräfte und ausreichende Personalstärken der Feuerwehren sind Voraussetzung für den hohen Qualitätsstandard der Feuerwehren in Deutschland. Es ist zentrale Zukunftsaufgabe des DFV, Vertrauen und Motivation zu fördern und die Mitgliedergewinnung durch geeignete Maßnahmen zu unterstützen.       6. Der DFV erkennt Leistungen an und fördert ein motivierendes Klima für das bürgerschaftliche Engagement       Motivation ist in hohem Maße davon abhängig, wie das haupt- und ehrenamtliche Engagement in den Feuerwehren anerkannt wird und wie die Rahmenbedingungen von Politik, Verwaltung und anderen gestaltet werden. Darum zeichnet der DFV besonderes Engagement für die Arbeit der Feuerwehren aus und unterstützt alle Maßnahmen, die das Ehrenamt fördern und damit die Bereitschaft der Bürgerinnen und Bürger stärken, in den Feuerwehren aktiv zu werden.       7.
